Hello! I am Long Qian, a fourth year PhD student in logic at Carnegie Mellon University. I am primarily interested in the interaction between logic
and computations, and am currently working on completeness properties of differential dynamic logic. Previously, I have worked on computable analysis and neighbouring subjects, such
as computable Banach spaces and their geometry.
