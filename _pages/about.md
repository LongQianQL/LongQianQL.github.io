Hello! I am Long Qian, a fifth year PhD student in mathematical logic at Carnegie Mellon University, I am fortunate to be advised by [Andr√© Platzer](https://symbolaris.com/). I primarily work on the logical foundations of differential equations through differential dynamic logic.

Previously, I have worked on computable analysis and neighbouring subjects, such as computable Banach spaces and their geometry. I am also interested in computer-assisted mathematics utilizing automated-reasoning tools.
